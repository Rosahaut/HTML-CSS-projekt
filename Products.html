                <p>X Series® is compact and lightweight and delivers the capabilities you expect from a full-featured defibrillator/monitor.
                    When it comes to durability, the X Series is tested to a more challenging standard than any other monitor on the market.
                    That’s because its durability is measured against the most current military-specified standards. </p>
